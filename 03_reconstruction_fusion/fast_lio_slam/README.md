# FAST_LIO_SLAM

## News
-  ``Aug 2021``: The Livox-lidar tests and corresponding launch files will be uploaded soon. Currenty only Ouster lidar tutorial videos had been made. 

## What is FAST_LIO_SLAM?
Integration of 
1. [FAST-LIO2](https://github.com/hku-mars/FAST_LIO) (Odometry): A computationally efficient and robust LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) package
2. [SC-PGO](https://github.com/gisbi-kim/SC-A-LOAM) (Loop detection and Pose-graph Optimization): [Scan Context](https://github.com/irapkaist/scancontext)-based Loop detection and GTSAM-based Pose-graph optimization

## Features
- An easy-to-use plug-and-play LiDAR SLAM 
    - FAST-LIO2 and SC-PGO run separately (see below How to use? tab).
    - SC-PGO takes odometry and lidar point cloud topics from the FAST-LIO2 node. 
    - Finally, an optimized map is made within the SC-PGO node. 

## Install ceres solver


## Install gtsam

```
sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev
cd $HOME/Documents/slam_src
git clone https://github.com/borglab/gtsam.git --recursive
cd gtsam

git checkout b1f441dea9c2c59354c363a60c6e0f01305985ee

mkdir build
cd build

# GTSAM can be installed locally, e.g., at $HOME/slam_devel, but 
# /usr/local is recommended as it has no issue when debugging in QtCreator.

```


## How to use?
- The below commands and the launch files are made for playing the [MulRan dataset](https://sites.google.com/view/mulran-pr/home), but applicable for livox lidars in the same way (you could easily make your own launch files).
```
    # terminal 1: run FAST-LIO2 
    mkdir -p ~/catkin_fastlio_slam/src
    cd ~/catkin_fastlio_slam/src
    git clone https://github.com/JzHuai0108/FAST_LIO_SLAM.git
    git clone https://github.com/Livox-SDK/livox_ros_driver
    cd .. 
    catkin_make -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python3.8 -DGTSAM_DIR=/usr/local/include/gtsam -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

    source devel/setup.bash
    roslaunch fast_lio mapping_ouster64_mulran.launch # setting for MulRan dataset 

    # open the other terminal tab: run SC-PGO
    cd ~/catkin_fastlio_slam
    source devel/setup.bash
    roslaunch aloam_velodyne fastlio_ouster64.launch # setting for MulRan dataset 

    # open the other terminal tab
    # run file_player_mulran (for the details, refer here https://github.com/irapkaist/file_player_mulran)
```

```
# one terminal

# another terminal
source devel/setup.bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/Documents/slam_devel/lib

### Coloradar dataset
```
mkdir -p /home/pi/Desktop/temp/arpg_lab_run1
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:~/Documents/slam_devel/lib
roslaunch aloam_velodyne fastlio_ouster64_coloradar.launch save_directory:=/home/pi/Desktop/temp/arpg_lab_run1/ bagname:=/media/pi/BackupPlus/jhuai/data/coloradar/rosbags/arpg_lab_run1.bag
```

### Custom dataset
Create launch files following the above examples, noting that the aloam nodes should be disabled and 
that aloam outputs should be substituted for by the fastlio outputs as in aloam_velodyne_HDL_32.launch.


## Utility
- We support keyframe scan saver (as in .pcd) and provide a script reconstructs a point cloud map by merging the saved scans using the optimized poses. See [here](https://github.com/gisbi-kim/FAST_LIO_SLAM/blob/bf975560741c425f71811c864af5d35aa880c797/SC-PGO/utils/python/makeMergedMap.py#L7).
